This program was developed in order to solve the issue of determining when a website's HTML changes.
If the HTML of a website changes at all, the website will be opened in a new tab.

In specific, this script is meant to be used for a popular clothing company named Supreme. They have extremely sought-after
clothing on their online webstore. Every Thursday at 9AM, their webshop page updates and will have all the new merchandise.

I used to refresh the page every few seconds just to see if the website updated, but now with this script I can just keep it
running as long as I want. 

One interesting thing I noticed about this script is that it does receive an error code under 1 condition: If the website
denies the script from checking the page due to the amount of requests in a certain time span, the script will stop running.
So keep this in mind when using the script and set the time interval accordingly. (IE: websites with alot of traffic
will most likely not have an issue with tons of requests, so you can put a very small interval such as 1 second, however,
a website that does not attract a lot of traffic may deny the requests in such a short time span so you may want to set the
interval to 30 seconds).
